In all honesty, this reading was truly eye-opening. Up until this point, I never really thought about the potential importance that these various websites can have not only to the brand of a company, but also the message that they send. Through this reading, I’ve come to learn that your website is a direct reflection of the sophistication and vibe that your restaurant gives off. It was really cool to see how well these different websites captured the essence of the various restaurants through different features and functionalities. I’m also slightly surprised that I didn’t realize this importance sooner. Coming from a marketing background, a lot of what I learn about is how things appear to consumers and how that consumer experience can be improved to better reflect a specific company/product. For me, in terms of restaurants, that often meant the quality of the food, the descriptions on the menu, and the name and slogan of the brand. I never thought too deeply about the role that the website itself plays in that, so it was cool to have that ideology be challenged through this reading. It also made me go back and take a closer look at the website of the restaurant I worked at in high school After looking more closely at this website, I realized that while it captured the essence of the restaurant's culture and ambiance, it seemed to fall short on feasibility and felt slightly outdated; both aspects I would have overlooked had it not been for this article.
